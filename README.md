# Transaction File Mapper

This is a API project which's developed using .Net Core 8 

## Getting Started
First, you need to install the <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0">.Net Core 8 SDK</a> and either the <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/tr/downloads/"> Visual Studio IDE</a> or <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/tr/downloads/">VS Code Editor</a> if you prefer not to use Visual Studio.

If you opt for VS Code, navigate to the `TransactionFileMapper` folder in your terminal and then execute the following commands:

```bash
cd TransactionFileMapper
dotnet run
```
This will run the API. 

After running the API, you should open the `index.html` file inside the `TransactionFileMapperFront` folder.

```bash
cd ..
open TransactionFileMapperFront/index.html
```
